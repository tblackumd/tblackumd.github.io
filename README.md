Hi, you've reached Travis Black's github repository.  I've put up some example projects for potential employers to look at.

Stocks.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that demonstrates usage of TD Ameritrade's API to get stock price history, and then organizes and uses this data to build a neural network for stock price prediction.  The network uses an attention based LSTM, as well as an embedding layer for sparse inputs.  It's accuracy is greater than 50%, but it's not accurate enough to make large profits from the stock market.  Above 50% is pretty decent, though - especially since some experts say that the stock market is essentially random.

I've also uploaded a PDF of a Storybook which I have made in tableau.  It includes a series of visualizations of U.S. lobbying data from between 2008-2019.  The data was collected as a result of the lobbying Disclosure Act; data files were scraped from the House and Senate Lobbying Disclosure websites.  The the PDF form isn't quite as sleek as the actual Tableau storybook, and also loses tooltip functionality, but the storybook itself is too big for this repository and most people don't have Tableau anyways.  If you want the actual storybook file, just reach out to me and I can send it.

I also have left up Democracy.ipynb, which was the original reason this github was created.  It was my final project for my Data Science class.  It's a jupyter notebook tutorial that demonstrates basic data organization, cleaning, and visualization.  It also shows usage of a basic feedforward neural network for prediction.

If you somehow ended up here and now want to reach me, you can contact me at travis.r.black@gmail.com
